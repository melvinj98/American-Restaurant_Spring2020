# Spring 2020
Space for collaboration for STAC's CS 485 Web Programming class "The American Restaurant" project.  

For the initial setup, we're going to have the structure set with the directories such as assets, css, includes.

- Fork this repository then clone your forked repository within your `htdocs` XAMMP directory.  
- Start your XAMMP server and run it against the newly cloned folder. 
- Verify that the index page is loading and you get some results, such as the heading and some text (things at first may look out of place and images will not load).
